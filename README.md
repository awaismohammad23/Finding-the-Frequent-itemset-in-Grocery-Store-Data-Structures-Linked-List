# Finding-the-Frequent-itemset-in-Grocery-Store-Data-Structures-Linked-List
This assignment will give you basic insight into using the Apriori algorithm. Apriori is used for finding
the frequent item set in a transaction. For example, in Supermarket stores customers can buy
different categories of items. There is always a pattern for what a customer buys. This pattern
changes according to the buyer. For example, if a buyer is a Player, and buys products such as
Bat, Ball then, it's most probable that he will purchase a tape too. But if the buyer is a mother
having babies, she will buy baby products such as milk and diapers. In short, every buyer’s
transaction involves a pattern. Our goal is to find those patterns in these transactions. Profit is
automatically generated if a relationship is found between the items purchased in different
transactions.
The Apriori algorithm was the first algorithm that was proposed for frequent itemset mining. Let’s
understand the Apriori algorithm using an example step by step:
You are given the grocery store dataset. The text file contains:
1. The first row of the file contains a Support threshold e.g. 0.5.
2. The second row contains the total number of transactions e.g., 6
3. Followed by transactions. Each transaction contains a different set of items separated by a comma. E.g., Bread, Cheese, Egg, Juice etc

**Example:**

**0.5
6
Bread, Cheese, Egg, Juice
Bread, Cheese, Juice
Bread, Milk-, Yougrt
Bread, +Juice@, Milk
Cheese, Juice, Milk1
Bread, Egg, Cheese, Juice**

The support threshold is 0.5 and there are a total no of 6 transactions the first transaction is
Bread, Cheese, Egg, and Juice in the above example.

The support threshold determines, whether is the item popular or not.
“A set of items that appears in many baskets is said to be “frequent.” To be formal, we assume
there is a number S, called the support threshold. If I is a set of items, the support for I is the
number of baskets(transactions) for which I is a subset. We say I is frequent if its support is S or
more” (reference: Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining for Predictive Analytics Book). In our
example, S= 0.5, and 6 is the number of transactions. So, an item is frequent if it repeats in 0.5 * 6 = 3 or
more transactions.

**Step 01:**

Read the file and store all the transactions in Link Lists (TransactionLL). Each transaction (e.g.
Bread, Cheese, Egg, Juice) will be a list of items. And transactions are itself a list.
Note: Since File I/O is a very costly operation, you are required to traverse the file once (multiple
traversals of a file result in ZERO marks).

**Figure 01:** TransactionLL

**Step 02:**
Perform preprocessing on TransactionLL:
a. Remove all the punctuations marks and numbers (.~ ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) _ + = “ ; : / ?
extra spaces or 0 to 9 digits.
Note: Remember
1) Output must only contain alphabets and space characters.
2) There must be a single space between two words (if the item name is composed of muti
words e.g., black pepper).
b. Convert all upper-case letters to lowercase (because “Bread” and “bread” both are the same
item).

**Step 03:**
you have to find the frequency of all the items using TransactionLL (updated in Step 02).

**Items Frequency**
**bread 5
cheese 4
egg 2
juice 5
milk 3
yogurt 1**

**Table 01:** Frequency of each item


**Step 03:**

Now evaluate Support threshold=0.5*No of transaction. So, you get threshold 0.5 * 6 = 3. The set
of 1st
– items whose occurrence is satisfying the Support threshold are determined. Only those
items that count more than or equal to Support the threshold are taken ahead for the next iteration
and the others are pruned (deleted). E.g., egg and yogurt have frequencies less than 3 (see Table
01). Remove Items that do not meet the minimum support threshold and sort them. Also, remove
those items from TransactionLL (Because we do not need nonfrequent items for next iterations).
The output should look like this.

**Table 02:** 1 st- ItemSet

**Items Frequency
bread 5
juice 5
cheese 4
milk 3**


**bread,cheese,juice
bread,cheese,juice
bread,milk
bread,juice,milk
cheese,juice,milk
bread,cheese,juice**

**Table 03:** TransactionLL


**Step 04:**

Next, 2-item pair candidate frequencies are discovered. The 2-item pairs are generated by forming
a group of 2 items using 1st – ItemSet (Table 02) and generate frequency using updated

TransactionLL (Table 03).

****Items Frequency****

**bread,juice 4
bread,cheese 3
bread,milk 2
juice,cheese 4
juice,milk 2
cheese,milk 1**

Table 03: Frequency of 2-item pairs
The 2-item candidates are pruned (deleted) using the Support threshold value and then sorted.
Now the table will have 2 –item sets with Support threshold.

**Item Frequency
bread, juice 4
juice, cheese 4
bread, cheese 3**

**Table 04:** 2nd – ItemSet

****Step 05:****
The 3-item pair candidates with frequencies are generated by grouping pair of 3 items using 1st –ItemSet (Table 02) and TransactionLL (Table 03).

****Item Frequency****

**bread,juice,cheese 3
bread,juice,milk 1
bread,cheese,milk 0
juice,cheese,milk 1**

Table 05: Frequency of 3-item pairs
The 3-itemset candidates are pruned (deleted) using Support threshold value.

****Item Frequency****

**bread, juice, cheese 3**

**Table 06:** 3rd – ItemSet

****Note:****
You are only required to generate 1st, 2nd & 3rd ItemSets.


By carefully analyzing these Itemsets, we can come up with a more detailed explanation of how
to make business decisions in retail environments. Now, we know Bread, Cheese, Juice and Milk
are frequent items and would place “Bread”, “Cheese” and “Juice” beside each other.
